# iappyxOS

**Generate real Android apps on your device — no server, no app store, no code.**

Describe what you want to your favorite AI, and iappyxOS turns it into a real installed APK with its own launcher icon. Building, signing, and installing all happen on-device. No cloud. No subscription. No coding required.

Sibling project to [iappyxOS Launcher](https://github.com/iappyx/iappyxOS-Launcher) (a programmable Android home screen) — both are standalone, and the same widget HTML runs in either one.

*My Apps • Create • 57 Demos • Generated Radio App • Icon Editor • Preview with Console*

## What it does

- **AI-generated App** — describe your app in plain language, let an AI generate the code, preview it, and build
- **Website as App** — turn any website into a lightweight standalone app (1MB, no bridges, sandboxed)
- **Demo Apps** — 57 pre-built apps to test native bridges (camera, GPS, NFC, BLE, SSH, network shares, and more)

Every generated app is a real signed APK that appears in your Android launcher. You can share it, uninstall it, or update it — just like any app. Generated apps pass Google Play Protect scanning.

## How it works

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         STANDARD LAUNCHER           │
│   App 1 🎯   App 2 📍   App 3 📷   │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               │ real installed APKs
┌──────────────▼──────────────────────┐
│         GENERATED APP SHELL         │
│  WebView + native bridge layer      │
│  HTML/JS injected as assets         │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               │ created and signed by
┌──────────────▼──────────────────────┐
│       CONTAINER APP (iappyxOS)      │
│  AI prompt → HTML → APK injection   │
│  → manifest patching → v2 signing   │
│  → PackageInstaller                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. User describes an app (or picks a template, or enters a URL)
2. HTML/JS is injected into a pre-built WebView shell APK
3. The Android manifest is binary-patched with a unique package name
4. The APK is signed on-device using the Android Keystore (hardware-backed)
5. The system installer dialog appears — the app shows up in the launcher

## Features

- **AI generation** — automatic via API (Anthropic, OpenRouter) or manual copy-paste to any AI
- **37 native bridge classes (140+ methods)** — camera, location, sensors, audio, notifications, push notifications (FCM), NFC, Bluetooth LE, Bluetooth Classic (serial), SSH/SFTP, SMB network shares, HTTP server/client, TCP/UDP sockets, WiFi Direct, mDNS, biometric, SQLite, contacts, SMS, calendar, clipboard, TTS, screen, vibration, alarms, media gallery, download manager, home screen widgets, scheduled background tasks, event triggers (charger / headphones / Bluetooth / WiFi / Android Auto), app-launch intents, and more
- **Bundled app files** — attach databases, JSON, images, or any data file to your app at build time. Accessible at runtime via `readAsset()` / `extractAsset()` — no download needed
- **Icon editor** — emoji, text, images, custom colors, gradients, shadows, filters, rotation, multiple layers
- **App management** — launch, rebuild, edit, share (APK, HTML, QR code, WiFi Direct), uninstall
- **QR code transfer** — share apps between devices via animated QR codes (no internet needed)
- **P2P sharing** — share built apps directly between devices via WiFi Direct
- **CSS style presets** — Material, Glassmorphic, Minimal, Dynamic (Material You colors) — applied globally
- **Preview** — test your app in a WebView with live JS console and simulated bridges before building
- **Offline-first** — everything except AI generation works in airplane mode
- **Configurable** — custom system prompt, app ID prefix, multiple AI providers, CSS styles
- **[Showcase](https://github.com/iappyx/iappyxOS-showcase)** — browse and build community apps directly in the app, or submit your own via PR
- **Home screen widgets** — generated apps can create configurable widgets with grids, clocks, timers, toggles
- **Background tasks** — scheduled JS execution even when the app is closed, auto-updates widgets
- **Version history** — automatic snapshots on rebuild, restore previous versions
- **Onboarding** — guided first-launch experience

## Quick start

1. [Download the latest Beta](https://github.com/iappyx/iappyxOS/raw/main/bin/iappyxOS.apk)
2. Sideload on Android 10+ (enable "Install unknown apps" for your browser)
3. Open iappyxOS → Create → pick a mode → build

**AI generation (two options):**
- **Manual (recommended)** — copy the generated prompt, paste it into any AI chat (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.), paste the HTML back, preview, build. The Manual flow offers two prompt variants:
  - **Full (~45 KB)** — works with any AI, no internet needed on the AI's side.
  - **Linked (~600 chars)** — tiny prompt that points the AI at [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md) via its canonical raw URL. Works with AIs that can fetch URLs (Claude.ai, ChatGPT with browsing, Gemini). Useful when your AI's paste limit rejects the full prompt.
- **Automatic** — add your API key in Settings (Anthropic or OpenRouter), then tap "Generate" in the Create flow

### Using the spec from any AI tool
`SPEC.md` at the repo root is the canonical iappyxOS bridge reference, always fetchable at:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iappyx/iappyxOS/main/SPEC.md
```
If you're chatting with Claude.ai or ChatGPT directly (outside the container), include that URL in your prompt and the AI will fetch it. When you get the HTML back, import it via Create → paste HTML.

## Sharing apps

Share your generated apps with others — multiple ways, no account needed:

- **Share APK** — send the compiled app file via any app (WhatsApp, email, Drive, Bluetooth)
- **Share Nearby** — transfer directly to another device via WiFi Direct, no internet required
- **Share via QR** — beam your app to another device using animated QR codes — no WiFi, no Bluetooth, just two screens
- **Share HTML** — export the source code so others can preview, modify, and rebuild it in their own iappyxOS

Recipients with iappyxOS installed can rebuild shared apps with their own icon and name.

## Native bridges

Generated apps access device hardware through a JavaScript bridge (`window.iappyx`):

| Bridge | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| Storage | Key-value, file storage, pick files, save to Downloads, share files, move/copy with content URI support |

## Building from source

### Prerequisites
- Android SDK
- Flutter 3.x
- Java 17+

### Quick build
```bash
./build.sh
# Output: bin/iappyxOS.apk (auto-installs if device connected)
```

### Manual build
```bash
# Shell APK (the template injected into generated apps):
cd src/shell_apk && ./gradlew assembleRelease
cp app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk ../container_app/assets/shell_template.apk

# Container app (iappyxOS itself):
cd src/container_app && flutter pub get && flutter build apk --release
```

> **Note:** Release builds require a signing keystore. Without `key.properties`, the build falls back to debug signing. See [Signing](#signing) below.

### Signing

The release APK is signed with a private keystore (not in this repo). To set up your own:

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore iappyxos-release.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias iappyxos
```

Create `src/container_app/key.properties`:
```
storePassword=YOUR_PASSWORD
keyPassword=YOUR_PASSWORD
keyAlias=iappyxos
storeFile=../../iappyxos-release.jks
```

Both files are gitignored. Never commit your keystore or passwords.
